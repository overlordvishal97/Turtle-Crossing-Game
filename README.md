# Turtle-Crossing-Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Turtle Crossing game using the Turtle graphics library in Python.

# Gameplay
The game starts with a turtle at the bottom of the screen and a road with moving cars.
The user can control the turtle using the 'w' and 's' keys to move up and down.
The goal is to cross the road without getting hit by a car.
Each time the turtle successfully crosses the road, the level increases and the cars move faster.
If the turtle gets hit by a car, the game is over.

# Code Organization
The code is organized into four files:\
main.py: The main game loop and event handling.
car_manager.py: The CarManager class, which manages the creation and movement of cars.
player.py: The Player class, which represents the turtle and its movements.
scoreboard.py: The Scoreboard class, which displays the level and game over message.

# Features
User input for controlling the turtle
Car movement and collision detection
Leveling system with increasing difficulty
Game over detection and display
Simple and easy to understand code

# Run the Game
To run the game, simply execute the main.py script. The Turtle graphics window will appear, and you can start playing!
